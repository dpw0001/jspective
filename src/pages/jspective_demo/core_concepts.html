		<p>
			JSpective is a minimalistic 3D engine implementing a vanishing point projection
			(Fluchtpunktprojektion) based solely on standard web technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
		</p>

		<h3>The core concept</h3>
		<p>
			Each topic presented on screen as a floating rectangle is internally represented
			by an object named Avatar.<br/>
			Each Avatar knows its current position P1(x,y,z) in a three-dimensional coordinate system.<br/>
		</p>

		<h3>The projection algorithm</h3>
		<p>
			The movement from current position P1 towards the target P2 is calculated in the
			three-dimensional space (like Vector = P2 - P1).<br/>
			For presentation on the two-dimensional screen, an Avatar's position, box size and font size
			are returned from a vanishing point projection of the three-dimensional data.
			This projection alghorithm is the core of the program and although being rather simple maths,
			it drives the application nicely - with only few lines of JavaScript and even less HTML.<br/>
		</p>

		<h3>The interactivity</h3>
		<p>
			A PageAvatar, when being clicked upon, will instantly send an AJAX request to the server
			and fetch the content for its topic in the background.<br/>
			While fetching the data, the PageAvatar will move to the side and front of the space
			and when arrived, open a viewport to display the data (content) in.<br/>
			When closing the viewport, the PageAvatar's box restarts its default behaviour floating around again.<br/>
