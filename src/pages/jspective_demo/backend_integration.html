		<h3>At a first glance</h3>
		<p>Because JSpective fetches all its data via AJAX requests anyway, integrating dynamic sources should be straight forward.<br/>
		Any http server will do the job. You can feed standard html pages or any XML into JSpective.</p>

		<h3>Sources and contexts</h3>
		Questions about the user interface's behaviour will arise, when data is to be symbolized and displayed.
		<ul>
			<li>What data - and in which context - is interesting being explored in a 3D browser?</li>
			<li>How should efficient user interface widgets look alike for that data and context?</li>
			<li>What 3D widget behaviour would add substantial value to a 2D world?</li>
			<li>Are there meshup scenarios for another killer application? You bet, there are! "No! Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try." (Yoda, Star Wars)</li>
		</ul>
		This project is in an highly experimental state. Join! :)<br/>
		
		<h3>Integration and feature requests</h3>
		I offer to implement your feature requests as a freelancer at average payment, whenever my current workload allows for it; go ahead: <a href="mailto:dani@wimpff.de">dani@wimpff.de</a> [1].<br/>
