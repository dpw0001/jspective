# About JSpective
JSpective is a minimalistic 3D engine implementing a vanishing point projection.

It is based solely on standard text-based web technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

So web browsers can view spatial web applications without plug-ins
and the front-end is still as text-based as any common webpage.

It is a toy project just for the fun and art.
